# CppClassDef
Helps generate class defs in C++

The reason why this is created is only that string concat cannot meet the need to generate a lot of classes. The usage is quite limited and the code is like rubbish. If anyone would ever need such a tool I would be grateful that you would try it. This can be really verbose, probably even more verbose than hand-writing all those classes all by yourself, but if you just want to skip the handwriting part or that you just enjoy the feeling of metaprogramming, maybe this can help you from inventing those square-shaped wheels once again.

# WARNING
This tool is written in C# and is only a library

Make sure you have a .NET SDK

# Usage
As you wish

# Limitations
A lot
